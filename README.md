## Install Docker Desktop
Ensure Docker Desktop is installed on both Mac and Windows.

## Set Up Traefik as a Reverse Proxy

## On Mac:
You can continue using dnsmasq or edit your /etc/hosts file to map .test domains to localhost.

## On Windows:
Youâ€™ll need to edit the C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts file:

## Copy code
```
127.0.0.1 my.recrut.test
127.0.0.1 admin.recrut.test
```
This allows both systems to resolve .test domains to localhost.


##  Run Docker Compose
```
docker-compose up -d
```

##  Access Your Services
You should now be able to access your services on both Mac and Windows via:

http://my.recrut.test

http://admin.recrut.test


## Summary
This setup with Docker, Traefik, and host file modifications allows you to run microservices locally on both Mac and Windows, using a common .test domain and subdomains. Traefik handles the routing internally, making the setup consistent across different operating systems.
